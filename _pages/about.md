<section class="introduction">
I am striving to leverage my diverse skills and experiences in the areas of
linguistics, counseling, customer service, engineering sales, etc
so that I will become a resourceful and unique developer.
</section>

<h2 class="h1">
  Linguistics
</h2>

At [Aichi Shukutoku University](http://www.aasa.ac.jp/) in Japan, I majored in Linguistics, with a specialization in Syntax.

Syntactical analysis is performed in our natural languages when we analyze
each part of the sentence and how it functions within the sentence.
Computer language does a similar thing via lexical analysis.

Because both syntactical analysis and lexical analysis are similar,
understanding how natural languages work is useful in understanding
computer languages.

<h2 class="h1">
  Counseling
</h2>

At [Waikato Institute of Technology](http://www.wintec.ac.nz/) in New Zealand, I obtained a certificate in Counseling.
As part of my Counseling major, I assisted young people experiencing
difficulties with empowerment, coping and self-care to identify best
solutions for moving forward and progressing in life.

Counseling skills can be useful in programming when working with clients
to assist them in identifying their programming needs and collaboratively
working with the clients to deliver a quality and meaningful product.

<h2 class="h1">
  Sales and engineering
</h2>

Because of my desire to use my counseling skills to work in sales and
my burgeoning interest in technology, I sought and landed a job as a
salesperson with [ESTIC](http://www.estic.co.jp/en/index.html),
an industrial machinary corporation in central Japan. In this role, I promoted [hand-held, high-precision nutrunner systems](http://www.estic.co.jp/products/product_en.php#Handheld Nutrunner) to Japan's top auto-makers, including Toyota and Honda.
I acquired not only sales and customer service skills,
but also some insight into mechanical and software engineering through
working with clients and in-house engineers.

<h2 class="h1">
  Self-directed coding
</h2>

Shortly after moving to the United States, I met a professional programmer
at a rock climbing gym. His passion for coding inspired me to research the
field.

I not only realized that programming was the career field
that I was interested in pursuing, but also realized that my past education
and job experiences were, in a sense, bread crumbs leading to a career in programming.

My IT-pro friends recommended me a few online courses such as Harvard's CS50. Since I started programming, I completed several online courses. I really appreciate the generosity of the industry. I feel like now is time to contribute back to the community in return.

### CS50
This is the one who taught me all the basics of Computer Science early on. I gained understanding of how computer software works and insight into data structures through a broad range of assignment projects (C, Linux, JavaScript, SQL, PHP, Cryptography, etc)

### Code adademy
This is where I practiced coding when I did not even know how to use a text editor.

### Other courses / tutorials I did

- [Web Application Architectures - University of New Mexico]({{ site.data.pdfs.certificates.web_apps }})
- [6.00.1x: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python - MIT]({{ site.data.pdfs.certificates.python }})
- [COMP102x: Introduction to Computing with Java - HKUST]({{ site.data.pdfs.certificates.java }})
- [Introduction to Linux - Linux Foundation]({{ site.data.pdfs.certificates.linux }})
- Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems - University of Maryland

<h2 class="h1">
  University of the District of Columbia
</h2>

Without hesitation, I enrolled in a Computer Science program at [University of the District of Columbia](http://www.udc.edu/) to complement my self-directed learning. Among others, I enjoyed the following excellent courses:

- Data Structures Using C++ (Professor: Joel Belcher)
- Web Design (Professor: Rachid Mrad)
- Digital Applications / Desktop Publishing

<h2 class="h1">
  Web development
</h2>

When I was itching to create something useful using my coding skills, I came across this web developing tutorial, [Ruby on Rails Tutorial by Michael Hartl](https://www.railstutorial.org/). It taught me how to build web applications as well as Unix command-line and other development tools. Ever since I am passionate about improving web application development skills. By following Rails philosophy and conventions, I was able to absorb key elements of web development rapidly. Now I want to expand my field of expertise towards web components using AngularJS and ReactJS.

<h2 class="h1">
  Web design
</h2>

I am currently striving to improve my web design skills with assistance of this [awesome designer](http://rachidmrad.com/#/portfolio) in Washington DC. To be honest, I was underestimating the importance of visual design for a long time. Now I realized that even if you are a back-end developer, being able to create something beautiful is a valuable ability.

My goal is to gain insight into web design and to be aware of good design so that I will be able to avoid making unattractive or hard-to-use user interfaces as I develop applications.
