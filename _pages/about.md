<section class="introduction">
I am striving to leverage my diverse skills and experiences in the areas of
linguistics, counseling, customer service, engineering sales, etc
so that I will become a resourceful and unique developer.

<h2>
  Linguistics
</h2>

At [Aichi Shukutoku University](http://www.aasa.ac.jp/) in Japan, I majored in Linguistics, with a specialization in Syntax.

Syntactical analysis is performed in our natural languages when we analyze
each part of the sentence and how it functions within the sentence.
Computer language does a similar thing via lexical analysis.

Because both syntactical analysis and lexical analysis are similar,
understanding how natural languages work is useful in understanding
computer languages.

<h2>
  Counseling
</h2>

At [Waikato Institute of Technology](http://www.wintec.ac.nz/) in New Zealand, I obtained a certificate in Counseling.
As part of my Counseling major, I assisted young people experiencing
difficulties with empowerment, coping and self-care to identify best
solutions for moving forward and progressing in life.

Counseling skills can be useful in programming when working with clients
to assist them in identifying their programming needs and collaboratively
working with the clients to deliver a quality and meaningful product.

<h2>
  Sales and engineering
</h2>

Because of my desire to use my counseling skills to work in sales and
my burgeoning interest in technology, I sought and landed a job as a
salesperson with [ESTIC](http://www.estic.co.jp/en/index.html),
an industrial machinary corporation in central Japan. In this role, I promoted [hand-held, high-precision nutrunner systems](http://www.estic.co.jp/products/product_en.php#Handheld Nutrunner) to Japan's top auto-makers, including Toyota and Honda.
I acquired not only sales and customer service skills,
but also some insight into mechanical and software engineering through
working with clients and in-house engineers.

<h2>
  Self-Directed Coding
</h2>

Shortly after moving to the United States, I met a professional programmer
at a rock climbing gym. His passion for coding inspired me to research the
field.

I not only realized that programming was the career field
that I was interested in pursuing, but also realized that my past education
and job experiences were, in a sense, bread crumbs leading to a career in programming.

My IT-pro friends recommended me a few online courses such as Harvard's CS50. Since I started programming, I completed several online courses. I really appreciate the generosity of the industry. I feel like now is time to contribute back to the community in return.

Early on, Harvard's CS50 and Codeacademy helped me absorb basic concepts of programming and computer science. I was able to gain understanding of how computer software works, insight into data structures and basic knowledge of several programming languages (C, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, PHP, Ruby, Python, etc)

<h2>
  Mobile development (Android)
</h2>

When I became comfortable with problem solving in coding, I started to want to
create something concrete using my programming skills, and I decided to learn
Android application development using Java. I learned it through the following resources:

- [Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems - University of Maryland](https://www.coursera.org/course/androidpart1)
- [Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide 2nd Edition](https://www.bignerdranch.com/we-write/android-programming/)

Then I made it to publish an app on the Google Play:

- [Moving Estimator (Android)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mnishiguchi.android.movingestimator)

<h2>
  Associate of Computer Science
</h2>

Without hesitation, I enrolled in a Computer Science program at [University of the District of Columbia](http://www.udc.edu/) to complement my self-directed learning. I was able to fortify my programming skills with better understanding of operating systems and data structures as well as intense programming trainings for C++ and Java. I also developed basic graphic designing skills with Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign. Here are some of the excellent courses that I really enjoy:

- Data Structures Using C++ (Professor: Joel Belcher)
- Web Design (Professor: [Rachid Mrad](http://rachidmrad.com/#/portfolio))
- Digital Applications / Desktop Publishing

<h2>
  Web development
</h2>

When I was itching to create a larger scale web application, I came across this web developing tutorial, [Ruby on Rails Tutorial by Michael Hartl](https://www.railstutorial.org/). It taught me how to build web applications as well as Unix command-line and other development tools. Ever since I am passionate about improving web application development skills. By following Rails philosophy and conventions, I was able to absorb key elements of web development rapidly. I managed to built a web service called "[Moving Estimator (Web)](https://moving-estimator.herokuapp.com/)".

Now I am ambitious to expand my field of expertise towards web components using AngularJS and ReactJS.
