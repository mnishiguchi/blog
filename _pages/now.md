## Work experience at large organization
I was very fortunate to have an opportunity to work for [American Petroleum Institute (API)](http://www.api.org/) for a few weeks, where I had an invaluable experience as a web programmer. Since previously I was just coding and creating small programs for myself, I was not aware of how much I could contribute using my skills. This experience at API made me confident. I really appreciate all the staff at API that warmly welcomed me even though it was a short-term contract. Thank you so much!

## Web designing
I am currently striving to improve my web designing skills with assistance of this [awesome designer](http://rachidmrad.com/#/portfolio) in Washington DC. I believe that even if you are a back-end developer, being able to create something beautiful is a valuable ability.

My goal is to gain insight into web design and to be aware of good design so that I will be able to avoid making unattractive or hard-to-use user interfaces as I develop applications.
