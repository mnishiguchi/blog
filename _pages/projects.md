## My first open-source contribution

I was trying to learn how to use one of Facebook's open-source projects
called fixed-data-table. Then I found this typo.
I fixed it immediately and sent a pull-request to its repository.
Awesome, they accepted it! This is my first contribution to
a famous project.

## Custom blog theme for Jekyll

This very website you are viewing right now is actually one of the most important project I have done before. Here I tinkered with new CSS/JS techniques to enhance user experience. I got a lot of inspiration from [Mr. Rachid Mrad](http://rachidmrad.com), my web design mentor.
