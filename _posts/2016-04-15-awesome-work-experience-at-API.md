title: Awesome work experience at API
---

I was very fortunate to have an opportunity to work for [American Petroleum Institute (API)](http://www.api.org/) for a few weeks, where I had an invaluable experience as a web programmer.

Since previously I was just coding and creating small programs for myself, I was not aware of how much I could contribute using my skills. This experience at API made me confident.

I really appreciate all the staff at API that warmly welcomed me even though it was a short-term contract. Thank you so much!
