Hi, I am Masatoshi Nishiguchi, an aspiring programmer who loves coding
and is passionate about building web and mobile applications.
I am originally from Japan, but currently live in the United States in Washington, DC.

## Tools and Languages

These are some of the development tools that I currently use and
programming languages that I have learned.
I am so thankful to generous, experienced coders who shared their
precious tutorials and other resources.

HTML5, CSS3, Ruby on Rails, AngularJS, JavaScript, CoffeeScript, jQuery,
ReactJS, Java (Android), Python, C/C++
OS X, Linux

iTerm, Sublime Text, Atom, Android Studio, NetBeans, Xcode, Vim

Git, Heroku, SQLite, PostgreSQL

Japanese, English, Spanish

I plan to leverage my diverse skills and experiences in the areas of
linguistics, counseling, customer service, engineering sales, etc
to become a resourceful and unique developer.

## Linguistics

At [Aichi Shukutoku University](http://www.aasa.ac.jp/) in Japan, I majored in Linguistics, with a specialization in Syntax.

Syntactical analysis is performed in our natural languages when we analyze
each part of the sentence and how it functions within the sentence.
Computer language does a similar thing via lexical analysis.

Because both syntactical analysis and lexical analysis are similar,
understanding how natural languages work is useful in understanding
computer languages.

## Counseling

At [Waikato Institute of Technology](http://www.wintec.ac.nz/) in New Zealand, I obtained a certificate in Counseling.
As part of my Counseling major, I assisted young people experiencing
difficulties with empowerment, coping and self-care to identify best
solutions for moving forward and progressing in life.

Counseling skills can be useful in programming when working with clients
to assist them in identifying their programming needs and collaboratively
working with the clients to deliver a quality and meaningful product.

## Sales and engineering

Because of my desire to use my counseling skills to work in sales and
my burgeoning interest in technology, I sought and landed a job as a
salesperson with [ESTIC](http://www.estic.co.jp/en/index.html),
an industrial machinary corporation in central Japan. In this role, I promoted [hand-held, high-precision nutrunner systems](http://www.estic.co.jp/products/product_en.php#Handheld Nutrunner) to Japan's top auto-makers, including Toyota and Honda.
I acquired not only sales and customer service skills,
but also some insight into mechanical and software engineering through
working with clients and in-house engineers.

## Computer programming

Shortly after moving to the United States, I met a professional programmer
at a rock climbing gym. His passion for coding inspired me to research the
field.

I not only realized that programming was the career field
that I was interested in pursuing, but also realized that my past education
and job experiences were, in a sense, bread crumbs leading to a career in programming.

Without hesitation, I enrolled in a Computer Science program at [University of the District of Columbia](http://www.udc.edu/).
