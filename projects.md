## Moving estimator (Android)

Once upon a time I was working for an international transportation company.
I created this application for movers to estimate the total volume
of their clients.

## Moving estimator (Web)
This is a public web service with which you can create a house move
project and estimate the volumes for each category or room.
It will help you discuss your moving with your movers.

## My first open-source contribution

I was trying to learn how to use one of Facebooks open-source projects
called fixed-data-table. Then I found this typo.
I fixed it immediately and sent the maintainers a pull-request.
Awesome, they accepted it! This is my first contribution to
a famous project.

## DCLearnJS

I belong to a few Meetup groups for networking with developers.
One is DCLearnJS where we learn JavaScript together.
I gave one presentation on ReactJS and contributed to improve its Github page.
